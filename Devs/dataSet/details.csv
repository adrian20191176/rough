Sleep Booster is based on the only extremely effective ðŸš€drug-free ðŸ™…â€â™€ï¸ option for overcoming sleeping problems. Unlike sleeping pills, it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habitsâœ¨. â­ï¸ HOW SLEEP BOOSTER WORKS â­ï¸ Falling asleep: Deep calm breathing leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep. â­ï¸ Sleep retention: Breathing technique results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning. â­ï¸ Awakening: After a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. Smart alarm analyzes your sleeping schedule and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts. â­ï¸ WHY DO YOU NEED SLEEP BOOSTER? Ask yourself the following questions: â“ Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep? â“ Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up? â“ Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day? â“ Are you struggling to stay organized? â“ Do you feel so tired that all you can think about is sleep? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you can definitely benefit from using Sleep Booster app for sleep and well-being improvement. Download Sleep Booster and enjoy your perfect sleeping experience. â­ï¸ WHY SLEEP BOOSTER? ðŸŒ We help you fall asleep easily. ðŸŒš We care about your sleep during the night. ðŸŒžWe wake you up smoothly with no stress.

Learn how to fast and get simple health tips you can use with Simple, the intermittent fasting app. Intermittent fasting is the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method and itâ€™s trusted by hundreds of millions worldwide! What is intermittent fasting (IF) and why can it help? IF is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans and anyone can benefit from it. You alternate eating and fasting periods. For example, you fast during a 16-hour window and can then eat during 8 hours (16:8 fasting). IF does not tell you what food you canâ€™t eat or to count your calories. Instead, it simply asks that you eat zero calorie during a specific period each day. This simple health app is worth it. Even short fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and reduce the risk of metabolic diseases. This small lifestyle change will enable you to reinstate normal processes in your body that youâ€™ve lost due to frequent eating. How do I start IF? You donâ€™t have to download many fasting apps or know anything about fasting. Simple will guide you and help you achieve your health goals. Simple is not just a fasting tracker. Itâ€™s an intermittent fasting app that provides you with health, weight loss, and cognitive power. This simple fasting app prepares a program, teaches you about IF, and helps you calculate fasting time mindfully and easy. What does Simple offer?

The techniques are a simple, practical relaxation method for anyone. You will learn to manage the stress in your life and improve your overall health using a tool you always carry with you: your breathing. The deep breathing exercises we present in our app stem from the Pranayama approach. Pranayama is a Sanskrit word referring to regulating your breathing for health benefits. It is an ancient Indian practice which is broken into 3 phases of breath manipulation. The phases are inhalation, retention, and exhalation. A 2014 study in the â€˜Journal of Diagnostic Researchâ€™ showed a connection between both slow and fast pranayama and reduced stress and improved overall cognition including attention, retention, and speed tasks combining vision and physical action, like video games. With our app, you will have the opportunity to set goals for yourself like reducing your stress and anxiety, sleeping better, and improving your concentration. You will work to meet these goals by personalizing your program based on your mood and using the daily mindfulness meditations provided. If youâ€™re looking for ways to be in better control or your stress and anxiety and have a more positive outlook, our app will help you. Maybe youâ€™ve tried other mindfulness apps with no success. Itâ€™s time to try BetterMe. Our app is a simple and manageable solution to beginning the journey to managing your stress and changing your outlook, and all you need to do is engage in our 3-minute meditations. Rather than try to force yourself to focus for long periods of time, which is difficult, especially if youâ€™re new to meditation, BetterMe provides short but effective science-backed meditations, which are personalized on a daily basis to increase your happiness. You have the choice to engage in guided meditations according to your mood or allow yourself to be freer and enjoy the fun, unguided meditations using sounds from nature. Let BetterMe accompany you on your journey to managing your stress and anxiety. Why You Should Choose BetterMe: with just 5 minutes each day, you will improve your quality of life by relieving stress and improving focus.

When practiced consistently, the techniques afford optimal vitality and can help ward off disease. Although people experience positive results from even a single breathing session, consistency is the key to generating persistent health-promoting effects. It takes time, effort and dedication to turn anything into a habit, and this is where the Wim Hof Method app can prove an invaluable tool. The app is designed to promote consistency by adding structure to your practice, and by being available to you anywhere, anytime.

With the content downloadable to your phone, the techniques and exercises are never more than a button press away, whether youâ€™re off the grid climbing a snow-capped mountain, or in a remote hotel room eager to breathe off the dayâ€™s eternal board meeting. Use the Wim Hof Method app to: - learn the why and how of the three pillars that make up the Wim Hof Method, with three introductory videos narrated by the Iceman Wim Hof. - develop and reinforce your practice with a series of training exercises for each pillar, all explained by Wim Hof. - time your breathing sessions with the integrated stopwatch. - log your breathing and exercise results, and track your progress with a calendar and bar graph. - find out what makes this all possible by reading about the underlying biochemical processes, as well as the scientific studies that have validated the Wim Hof Method, with the â€˜Wim Hof Method explainedâ€™ PDF document. - have Wim by your side at all times, as he guides your breathing sessions with his soothing voice in the One-on-Ones audio files.

Our copyrighted algorithms guide you from an awake, reactionary mind into an intuitive, creative state, then to a place where super-learning and healing occur, with the outcome being a heightened state of consciousness with crystal clear focus. Unlike meditation programs, BrainTapâ€™s proprietary neuro-algorithms gently and naturally guide your brain through a broad range of brainwave patterns, instead of just a meditative state. Only BrainTapâ€™s large selection of specialized sessions can produce this symphony of brainwave activity and our bundles include options for: - Stress Relief - Go-To-Sleep - Weight Wellness - Wake-Up - Children & Learning - Optimal Health - and more. The calming, rejuvenating effects of 10 to 20 minutes of braintapping serves to balance your nervous system and inoculate you against the stressors of everyday life. Daily braintapping trains your brain to be resilient and creative, and it activates the right mental states at the right time.

When you follow a ketogenic diet by reducing your carb intake to less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body will start producing ketones in the liver. You will enter ketosis and start using fat and ketone bodies as energy source. One of the main benefits of ketosis is its ability to suppress appetite. While your ketone levels will increase, your blood glucose levels and insulin levels will drop, leading to satiety. You will naturally eat less and the number of calories eaten will drop.
